* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the Numerical Representation experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Numerical Representation/Numerical Representation_01_Usability.org][Numerical Representation_01_Usability.org]]

* Post conditions
   - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Refer to [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Numerical Representation/Numerical Representation_06_Experiment.org][Numerical Representation_06_Experiment.org]]
  2. Click on 'Go to Lab' link 
  3. Insert the code in the box and select the problem number from the dropdown list present at the problem number field
  4. Select the Language either c(or)c++ from the dropdown list present at the language field
  5. Check the toogle bar, and click on the buttons displayed in the box
  6. Now uncheck the toogle bar

* Expected result
  1. Refer to [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Numerical Representation/Numerical Representation_06_Experiment.org][Numerical Representation_06_Experiment.org]]
  2. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process displayed on the screen
  3. The inserted code,selected problem number and selected language should be displayed on the screen
  4. The seleted buttons should work and when we uncheck the toogle bar the features in the box should get disappear
