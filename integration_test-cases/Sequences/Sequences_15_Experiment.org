* Objective
  - To perform the Experiment of the Sequences experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sequences/Sequences_01_Usability.org][Sequences_01_Usability.org]]

* Post conditions
   - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Refer to [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/problem-solving-iiith/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Sequences/Sequences_06_Experiment.org][Sequences_06_Experiment.org]]  
  2. Click on 'Go to Lab' link 
  3. Insert the code in the box and select the problem number from the dropdown list present at the problem number field
  4. Select the Language either c(or)c++ from the dropdown list present at the language field
  5. Select the Hint level from the dropdown list present at the hint field and and now change the hint level(eg:from hint1 to hint4)

* Expected result

  2. It should redirect to a new tab with the simulation process displayed on the screen
  3. The inserted code,selected problem number and selected language should be displayed on the screen
  4. The hint level should get changed to the modified level and it should be displayed on the screen
